# crafting-interpreters

My work as I go through the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) book.

## Implementations

- `jlox`: the book's Java tree-walk interpreter, with a few changes to take advantage of newer Java features
- `jli`: Jona's Lox Interpreter, my version of the tree-walk interpreter written in Rust
- `clox`: the book's C bytecode VM
- `yalv`: Yet Another Lox VM, my version of the bytecode VM written in Rust
